			<h2> About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is Ayren Thomas and I am a junior psychology major with an advertising and marketing minor. I am 21 years old and I have a little sister who is 19 and lives in Paris for school. I was born in Boston and moved down to Greenville South Carolina when I was 5. I spent elementary school there. Then, my family and I lived in France during middle school and my first year of high school because my Dad works for Michelin and which is a French company. I still speak french but not nearly as well as I used to. This is my second time living in South Carolina. I did ballet for 9 years when I was younger and I still love it but I stopped after moving back to Greenville the second time. After graduating I hope to move away and visit someplace new.</p>

				<span id="first"></span></p><p><span id="more">My favorite color is purple. Lavender specifically. When I was younger, my sister and I were assigned colors since were look similar and are so close in age. Her color was pink and mine was purple. I did not like that someone had assigned me a color so I rebelled for a while and made my favorite color red. Until I reached middle school and realized that I really did like purple. I try to incorporate it into a lot of what I wear. Even the braids I put in my hair some part will be purple. The front of my hair is also dyed purple. </span></p>

			<h2>My Future Career Plans </h2>
			<p>Coming into college I knew I wanted to do something with psychology but I didn't know what options I had besides being a psychologist. I had the opportunity to participate in a summer program by faculty and graduate students in the psychology department where each session we were introduced to the different branches of psychology and what conducting research in those fields looked like. The graduate students shared their experiences during their undergraduate studies and how they were able to get involved in research opportunities at their universities. The faculty also shared their stories and how they discovered their research interests and the way they were able to research while having a teaching position. </p>
			<p>Through this experience, I was able to find and connect with professors at my university who were conducting research. I became involved in The African American Faith Communities Project research lab. That was when I discovered that I wanted to go into research. My goal for my education is to go as far as possible. I hope to go to graduate school and complete my master's and Ph.D. in psychology. I hope to meld my interest in cognitive and social psychology into something new and provide new insight into how decisions are made and what motivates people to make them. I also want to bring more diversity into the field of research.</p>
